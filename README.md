## Abstract

This project evaluates the performance of several machine learning models, including linear regression, robust linear regression, support vector machines (SVM) with different kernels, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), decision trees, bagged trees, boosted trees, and a naïve random walk model. The models are trained to forecast natural gas prices for one, three, five, and ten days ahead (t+1, t+3, t+5, and t+10).

The study highlights the effectiveness of linear and ensemble-based machine learning models in short-term natural gas price forecasting and underscores their potential utility for various stakeholders in the natural gas market.
